AERPAW-Dev/AHN/E-VM/Profile_software/ README file

The directory structure rooted here (AERPAW-Dev/AHN/E-VM/Profile_software/) contains various software that will
be provided as experimenter tools, sample experiments that can be either customized or used as-is by the
experimenters, and any other experimenter support software to which the experimenter is given both read and modify
(customize) access.  THERE SHOULD BE NO CODE DIRECTLY IN THIS DIRECTORY.  Instead, all code should be
homed in one of the sub-directories of this directory.
